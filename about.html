                <h2>Meet the Owner</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Tiara Wilder, and I'm the proud owner of Wilder Residential Services. As a single mom and small business owner, I know how important it is to come home to a space that feels clean, comfortable, and stress-free. That's why I started this business — to help families, professionals, and busy individuals enjoy more peace of mind in their homes.</p> 
                <p>I've been serving the Sumter area and neighboring communities like Columbia, Bishopville, and Hartsville for the past two years, and I take pride in providing reliable, detailed, and personalized cleaning services. For me, this work isn't just about cleaning — it's about creating a welcoming environment where people can truly relax and focus on what matters most.</p> 
                <p>When you choose Wilder Residential Services, you're not just hiring a cleaning company — you're supporting a local small business that values trust, consistency, and care.</p>

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Wilder Residential Services was founded in 2023 with a simple mission: to bring comfort, care, and peace of mind into every home that we clean. What started as a one-woman operation in Sumter, South Carolina, has grown into a trusted small business that proudly serves families and homeowners in Sumter, Bishopville, Hartsville, Columbia, and surrounding areas.</p>
                <p>As a single mom and entrepreneur, I understand the importance of creating a clean, safe, and welcoming home environment. That's why Wilder Residential Services isn't just about cleaning—it's about caring for your home as if it were my own.</p>
                <p>Over the past two years, we've had the honor of helping families, busy professionals, and neighbors reclaim their time and enjoy the comfort of fresh, peaceful spaces. With each service, I bring reliability, attention to detail, and the personal touch that only a small, locally owned business can provide.</p> 
                <p>At Wilder Residential Services, every sweep, shine, and sparkle reflects not only our commitment to quality, but also the heart and dedication behind the business.</p>
